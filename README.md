hello-world
===========

I am a freelance writer and technology enthusiast that is working hard to develop new skills. I've learned the art of improvisational acting, performed stand-up comedy, and most recently enrolled in Udacity's front-end web development nano degree. I live by the words, "if you want something different in life then you have to do something different!"
