hello-world
===========

I am a freelance writer and technology enthusiast that is working hard to develop new skills. I've learned the art of improvisational acting, performed stand-up comedy, and most recently enrolled in Udacity's front-end web development nano degree. I live by the words, "if you want something different in life then you have to do something different!"
Learning HTML and CSS presents unique challenges that I'm excited to overcome. Hopefully, by the end of my studies I'll have a professional portfolio to present and new skills to offer contractors and potential employers.
